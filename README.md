# OCI SDK Python - Object-Storage
In this example, We will see important methods used in OCI SDK Python for read, write, upload, download  files in a bucket root or bucket folders path.

**Prerequisites:**
1. You must create a user with privileges in OCI Console

5. Before starting to program code in Python, We must have PIP and Python installed in the server where We are going to execute the Python programs, which by default is already installed on Oracle Linux servers.
      https://yum.oracle.com/oracle-linux-python.html
      
6. Install and configure OCI CLI, in the server where you will execute python programs:
      https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliinstall.htm
      
   Once OCI Cli is installed, you must be able to execute CLI commands and access your tenant's services.
     
7. Finally install OCI SDK for Python
